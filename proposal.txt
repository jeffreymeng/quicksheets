Project Description
===================
The name of my term project is quicksheets. It's a spreadsheet application that
can handle reading & editing CSV files, as well as spreadsheet formulas. The app
will support a variety of formulas, and will have a pleasant formula editing
experience, including syntax highlighting.

Structural Plan
===================
My project will compose of three major parts:
1. Graphics, which is in charge of rendering the spreadsheet and handling input
2. Spreadsheet, which is in charge of storing the spreadsheet data and determining
    which cells need to have their value recomputed.
3. Formulas, which is in charge of parsing spreadsheet formulas and computing

Algorithmic Plan
===================
I believe the most complex part of my project will be parsing and evaluating formulas,
and also determining which cells need to be updated as a result of editing a cell.

1. Parsing & Evaluating Formulas
I plan to handle parsing and evaluating formulas in a few steps.
The first step, lexing, will consist of reading in the formula and splitting
it into its component tokens. For example, "3 * (8 + SUM(A1:B4))" would be split
into a list of tokens: number 3, operator *, control character (, number 8,
operator +, formula SUM, control character (, range col1 A row1 1 col2 B row2 4,
control character ), and control character )
The second step, parsing, will read in the resulting tokens from lexing and

Version Control Plan
====================
I plan to back up my code using GitHub. See the image version-control.png.
